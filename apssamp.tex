\section{Introduction} % Morten + Johannes + Niyaz
Entanglement is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation. In fact, the generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing, including superconducting circuits~\cite{Steffen1423}, tapped ions~\cite{}, semiconductor quantum dots~\cite{Li809}, color-center defects in diamond~\cite{}, and neutral atoms in optical lattices~\cite{Saffman1010} just to name a few.

\textcolor{blue}{JP will work on this paragraph}
Platforms based on individual atoms (in free space or in solid matrices), electrons or collections of photons are also under development in research laboratories and startup companies. Unlike the synthetic fabricated qubits in solid-state platforms, atoms, electrons and photons are natural and replicable qubits, and the challenges reside less in physics breakthroughs and more in systems engineering.  Architectures based on trapped atomic ions with dense connectivity have demonstrated the highest fidelity operations and are viewed by many as the leading contender for scalable universal quantum computing.  In addition, arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms, with a backbone like trapped-ion systems, have emerged with new demonstrations of high-fidelity gates and scalable architectures.  Trapped electron systems, while earlier in development timeline have recently been demonstrated as novel “natural” qubits [8] that admit to precision control [9], [10] and the promise of high-fidelty gates in architechtures similar to trapped ions [9].

\textcolor{red}{{Here we show ... Could someone add 3-4 bulleted points here}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How an effective double-well potential can be constructed from seven
        anodes underneath a liquid helium surface.
        % TODO: Someone with more understanding than me regarding this process
        % should improve on this point.
    \item How we can construct a two-qubit architecture by trapping a single
        electron in each well, with always-on Coulomb interaction.
    \item How the anodes can be tuned to make the system two effective single
        qubits, and perform a two-qubit gate.
\end{itemize}


Technological advances in QIS, particularly in superconducting qubit and trapped ion experiments, have also created the opportunity to explore the generation of entanglement in emerging QIS systems based on trapped electrons~{}. Some statement of why one would like this kind of thing. Faster electron chain phonons, no screening, so very strong Coloumb interactions. paradigm for studying the role of entanglement produced purely by the Coloumb interaction and what kinds of entanglement protocols are possible.

The system of electrons on helium is quantum non-degenerate, the system parameters that are achievable 

This could also be a platform to investigate the crossover from purely classical to quantum mechanical representation of the system of electrons on helium. 

Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol schemes for two-qubit logic. In superconducting circuits the interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling between circuit element or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange interaction~\cite{blais2020circuit}. This allow to implement various schemes for entanglement, such as $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gate~\cite{bialczak2010quantum}, controlled-phase gate~\cite{dicarlo2009demonstration}, resonator-induced phase gate~\cite{paik2016experimental}, cross-resonance gate~\cite{chow2011simple} etc. Entanglement gates in trapped ions are produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used for transferring excitations between ion qubits~\cite{cirac1995quantum}. This has been experimentally demonstrated by implementing Cirac-Zoller gate~\cite{turchette1998deterministic}, Leibfried’s geometric-phase gate~\cite{leibfried2003experimental} etc. In photonic quantum computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded into waveguides~\cite{bartlett2020universal}. Two-qubit gates in semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange interactions~\cite{brunner2011two,watson2018programmable} or generated by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit interaction~\cite{borjans2020resonant}.

In the system of charge qubits one can generate entanglement via Coulomb interaction, where state-dependent charge configuration in one qubit impose different electric fields on the other qubit. \textit{discuss several examples, working on it, Niyaz}

Coulomb interaction governed entanglement naturally can be realized in the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of different electrons do not overlap. This results in a strong exchange free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the electrons~\cite{dykman2003qubits}. The lack of disorder in the systems also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest to the system as a candidate for quantum information processing~\cite{platzman1999quantum,lyon2006spin,schuster2010proposal}. Advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques have opened the door for the study of electrons on helium in confined geometries and mesoscopic devices. Single-electron detection has been experimentally achieved~\cite{glasson2005trapping,koolstra2019coupling} along with stable, high-fidelity, electron transfer along a gated CCD array~\cite{bradbury2011efficient}. Filamentation of electron current was observed in helium-filled microchannels along with electron crystallization and ``slip-stick'' dynamics of the Wigner solid~\cite{glasson2001observation,rees2016structural,rees2016stick}, where strong Coulomb interactions driven many-body phenomena were explored.


Electrons on helium is another qubit platform. Here 2 qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner.

The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange process between two charge particles according to quantum electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges generating quantum entanglement.

Understanding the behavior of strongly confined electrons is of fundamental
interest for solving many-body problems.  Quantum dots, e.g. electrons
confined in semiconducting heterostructures, are of particular interest since
they exhibit, due to their small size, discrete quantum levels.  Under these
conditions, typical quantum phenomena like tunneling, entanglement and
magnetization can all be observed.   Since quantum
dots are manufactured and designed artificially at the laboratory, their
quantum levels can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the external field or the
size and shape of the system.  As a consequence, quantum dots provide a high
level of control for the dynamics and correlation of the electrons, which
makes them perfectly suited to study quantum effects in practice.  Since their
ground state shows similar shell structures and magic numbers as seen for
atoms and nuclei, these systems give the opportunity to
study electronic systems without the presence of a nucleus affecting the
electrons.  Apart from their relevance for theoretical research in quantum
physics, quantum dots offer a wide variety of applications: In particular,
their electrical and optical properties make them attractive for the use in
laser technology \cite{strauf2010,5075760} and solar cells
\cite{jenks:013111,doi:10.1021/cr900289f}, but they are also used in quantum
computers\cite{PhysRevA.57.120} and medical imaging \cite{Ben-Ari02042003}.


Our work's place in this field

%Electrons on helium represent a promising platform for investigating strongly-coupled qubits. Therefore a systematic investigation of the controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is of significant importance for quantum information processing using trapped electrons.

\section{Device prototype}\label{sec:device} % Niyaz writes this
%general information about electrons on helium
\textit{Niyaz / add references to microdevice works, eNe} Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface, which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of vacuum. The weak interaction with enviorment, which is mainly governed by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for any qubit platform. SSE's in-plane motion can be further localized by using microdevices on the length scales approaching the interelectron separation (at the order of one micron).

\textit{Niyaz / Need to rewrite this section, include FEM} The prototype system for measurements of two electron's in-plane motional state entanglement is sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig1}a. Here we consider a $3 \times 1$~$\mu$m$\times\mu$m size structure with a recess depth 0.5~$\mu$m, which is filled with superfluid helium via capillary action~\cite{marty1986stability}. Once teh device is filled with helium, a thermionic emission from a tungsten filament located above the helium surface can be used to generate electrons, which will be naturally trapped at the liquid surface under positive bias voltage on the electrode g1-7. We note, that trapping single or two electrons requires a controlled delivery of electrons from a large bath of electrons, which was experimentally demonstrated. For the purpose of the current study we consider a simple gate array which allow a demonstration of entanglement between two electrons. The chip design and distances are chosen to promote a quantization axis along $x$ direction and keeping electron motional states along $y$-axis at sufficiently higher energies. Seven 200~nm-wide electrodes with 200~nm gap beneath the helium layer gives enough degrees of freedom to form a double-well electrostatic confinement. The electrostatic potential at the trap region is defined as:
\begin{align}
            V(x) = \sum_{i=1}^7 \alpha_i(x) V_i,
            \label{eq:trap}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_i$ is the relative contribution from each electrode shown in Fig~\ref{fig1}b and $V_i$ are voltages applied to them, and we keep top electrodes at the ground potential. The coupling constants $\alpha_i$ are calculated by numerically solving Laplace equation for electrostatic potential using Finite Element Modelling techniques. In our scheme the double-well is achieved by providing a negative potential to the central electrode (electrode 4 in Fig.~\ref{fig1}a) with a more positive potentials applied to other electrodes. The particular choice of the applied voltage will be described in a Section IV.

\textit{Niyaz / Introduce hamiltonian}

\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figure1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig1} (a) Schematic of the microdevice, where two electrons are trapped in a double-well potential created by electrodes 1-7. The read-out is provided by two superconducting resonators dispersively coupled to  electron's in-plane motional states. (b) Coupling constants from each individual electrode beneath the helium layer. (c) The electron's energy in a  double-well electrostatic potential (solid line). Dashed and dot-dashed lines represent the harmonic approximations of left and right wells respectively.}
\end{figure}

The electron motional states read-out scheme is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig1}a and is based on the coupling of motional states to the photons in the superconducting resonator. We estimate the coupling energy to be $g/2 \pi = \langle 1 | d E| 0 \rangle \simeq $. The largest contribution to the decoherence is realized via energy decay into phonons of the liquid helium, which was estimated to be. This allow the realization of the strong coupling regime $g \rangle \Gamma$. Each of the individual electrons coupled to its own cpw $\lambda/4$-resonator with different resonance frequencies. We estimate the crosstalk coupling of the electron to the other resonator to be, so we will ignore this. However this crosstalk will limit the fidelities of the gate and well developed the pulse shaping techniques can be used to mitigate this coupling. In a dispersive regime, realized at the condition, the frequency of the reonators becomes electron state-dependent, which can be measured via transmitted microwave signals through the cpw feedline.

% \section{Interaction driven entanglement}
% 
% In order to study the importance of level avoided crossings and
% entanglement, we study first a simple two-level system. Thereafter we
% extend our level-crossing model to a four-level system which can be
% interpreted as composed of two separate (not necessarily identical)
% subsystems.
% 
% We let our Hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $\lambda$
% \[
%        H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
% \]
% with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
% represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
% system, respectively.  The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
% two available states, which we label $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert
% 1\rangle$, respectively. Below we will let state $\vert 0 \rangle$
% represent the lowest state (often referred to as model-space state)
% eigenvalue whereas state $\vert 1\rangle$ represents the eigenvalue of
% the excluded space.  The non-interacting solutions to our problem are
% 
% \[
%        H_0\vert 0 \rangle =\epsilon_0\vert 0 \rangle,
% \]
% and
% \[
%        H_0\vert 1\rangle =\epsilon_1\vert 1\rangle,
% \]
% with $\epsilon_0 < \epsilon_1$. We label the off-diagonal matrix
% elements $X$, while $X_0=\langle 0 \vert H_\mathrm{I}\vert 0 \rangle$ and
% $X_1=\langle 1 \vert H_\mathrm{I}\vert 1 \rangle$.  The Hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized is then given by
% \[
% \left(\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_0+\lambda X_0 &\lambda X \\
% \lambda X &\epsilon_1+\lambda X_1 \end{array}\right).
% \]
% 
% In the results below we set the parameters $\epsilon_0=0$,
% $\epsilon_1=4$, $X_0=-X_1=3$ and $X=0.2$.  This eigenvalue problem can
% easily be rewritten in terms of the standard Pauli matrices.  The
% non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
% Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
% the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
% is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
% the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
% $\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
% eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
% value of the parameter $X$ represents the strength of the coupling
% between the model space and the excluded space.  
% % add figure here
% 
% This  model exhibits a simple level crossing where the
% composition of the final interacting states change character as we
% gradually switch on the interaction.  In order to study how
% entanglement relates to level crossing and the main results of our
% investigations, we extend the simple two-level system to a four level
% system. This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
% $A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states
% 
% \[
% \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
% \]
% 
% The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
% This leads to the many-body computational basis states
% \[
% \vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
% \]
% and
% \[
% \vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
% \]
% and
% \[
% \vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
% \]
% and finally
% \[
% \vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
% \]
% These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
% \[
% H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
% \]
% \[
% H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
% \]
% \[
% H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
% \]
% and
% \[
% H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
% \]
% The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
% \[
% H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
% \]
% 
% where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
% \[
% \bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
%                        0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
%                        0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}+H_z & 0 \\
%                        H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} -H_z \end{bmatrix}.
% \]
% 
% The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
% define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
% first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is
% 
% \[
% \rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11\
%  \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
% \]
% where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
% resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.  We can
% then in turn define the density matrix for the subsets $A$ or $B$ as
% 
% \[
% \rho_A=\mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho_{0})=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{B}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{B},
% \]
% or
% \[
% \rho_B=\mathrm{Tr}_A(\rho_{\Psi_0})=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{A}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{A}.
% \]
% 
% The density matrices for these subsets can be used to compute the
% so-called von Neumann entropy, which is one of the possible measures
% of entanglement. A pure state has entropy equal zero while entangled
% state have an entropy larger than zero. The von Neumann entropy is
% defined as
% \[
% S(A,B)=-\mathrm{Tr}\left(\rho_{A,B}\log_2 (\rho_{A,B})\right).
% \]
% The example here shows the above von Neumann entropy based on the
% density matrix for the lowest many-body state. We see clearly a jump
% in the entropy around the point where we have a level crossing. At
% interaction strength $\lambda=0$ we have many-body states purely
% defined by their computational basis states. As we switch on the
% interaction strength, we obtain an increased degree of mixing and the
% entropy increases till we reach the level crossing point where we see
% an additional and sudden increase in entropy. Similar behaviors are
% observed for the other states. The most important result from this
% example is that entanglement is driven by the Hamiltonian itself and
% the strength of the interaction matrix elements and the
% non-interacting energies.
% 
% % add figs here
% 
% With these introductory examples, we are now in the position where we
% can start to interpret and model realistic interacting many-electron
% systems in terms of the strength of the Coulomb interaction and the
% shapes of the potential well. Our specific system is composed of two
% potential wells with one fermion (electrons in our case) trapped in
% each well.  Each potential well can sustain a certain number of bound
% single-particle states and defines our subsystems $A$ and $B$. The
% non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian is given by the mere addition
% of the single-particle energies from each respective well (make figure
% with labels A and B and single-particle energies).
% 
% The eigenstates of the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_0$ are given by
% various computational basis states with the difference from the above
% simple models that now we have more than two states in each
% subsystem. The depths of the potential wells and their respective
% distances can be tuned in an experimental set up. The theoretical
% calculations presented here can thus serve as a tool which aids in
% finding the optimal parameters in order to study entanglement in a
% many-body environment.
% 
% What follows is a description of the theoretical models used to
% simulate the two-electron system. 

\section{Entanglement in quantum dot systems}
    As we are studying a model comprised of two electrons restricted to move in a
    one-dimensional external potential we have employed exact diagonalization of the
    two-body Schrödinger equation to solve the problem.
    We build a two-particle wave function from a set of single-particle
    functions.
    The basis of single-particle functions we will use are eigenstates of the
    one-body Hamiltonian represented on a discrete grid.
    This allows for flexibility in the choice of the external potential, and fits the
    interpolated potential particularly well.

    \subsection{The Hamiltonian}
        The full Hamiltonian for two interacting electrons in an external
        potential $v(x)$ is given by
        \begin{align*}
            \hat{H}
            = \sum_{i = 1}^{2}\qty(
                -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\dv[2]{}{x_i}
                + v(x_i)
            )
            + u(x_1, x_2),
        \end{align*}
        where we use a soft-Coulomb interaction $u(x_1, x_2)$ given by
        \begin{align}
            u(x_1, x_2)
            =
            \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{\qty(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
            \label{eq:soft-coulomb}
        \end{align}
        where we have set $e = (4 \pi \epsilon_0)^{-1} = 1$.
        % Note: Scaling should maybe be discussed in full when introducing kappa
        Here $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction, and $a$ removes
        the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.
        The Coulomb interaction is symmetric with respect to the positions and
        $u(x_1, x_2) = u(x_2, x_1)$.
        The kinetic energy operator and the external potential $v(x_i)$ constitutes
        the one-body part of the Hamiltonian.
        We will denote the one-body Hamiltonian by $\hat{h}$.
        There is no spin-dependence in this system, and we will restrict our attention
        to the spatial part of the problem.
        % TODO: Reference work discussing the suitability of this for the liquid
        % helium system.
        % This can be done by referring to the section on spin considerations.
        For numerical analysis we wish to use a dimensionless expression for the
        Hamiltonian.
        This is done by...
        % Note: Recap the steps needed to construct the dimensionless Hamiltonian.
        % TODO: Niyaz will handle this in the introduction

    \subsection{Constructing the single-particle basis sets}
        % TODO: Add comment on the non-variational nature of the finite-difference
        % basis sets.
        As much of the analysis will be performed by varying the shape and
        strength of the interpolated external potential we deem a flexible
        finite-difference basis set a suitable candidate.
        % TODO: List some other alternatives such as e.g., gaussians and DVR.
        The single-particle time-independent one-dimensional system can be
        described by the one-body Hamiltonian
        \begin{align*}
            h(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\dv[2]{}{x}
            + v(x),
        \end{align*}
        where the external potential $v(x)$ is an arbitrary function of the grid $x$.
        We proceed by discretizing the grid into $N_g$ uniform points with a spacing
        $\Delta x$ and use the second-order central differences method for the
        double-derivative.
        Building a tridiagonal matrix from the grid points, we solve the eigenvalue
        equation and choose the $l \leq N_g$ first eigenstates (i.e., the eigenstates
        with the lowest eigenenergy) as the single-particle basis
        $\{\psi_i\}_{i = 1}^l$.
        These basis states will be normalized with respect to the dot product (as we
        find the coefficients of the discretized grid).
        That is, $\sum_{j = 1}^{N_g} | \psi_i(x_j) |^{2} = 1$, however we want our
        states to be normalized with respect to the integral which entails a
        differential $\dd{x} \approx \Delta x$.
        As our grid is uniform we can then normalize the single-particle states
        by $\psi_i(x_j) \to \psi_i(x_j) / \sqrt{\Delta x}$.
        We then get $\braket{\psi_i}{\psi_j} = \delta_{ij}$ and the one-body matrix
        elements are given by
        \begin{align*}
            h_{ij} \equiv \mel{\psi_i}{\hat{h}}{\psi_j}
            = \delta_{ij}\varepsilon_j,
        \end{align*}
        where $\varepsilon_j$ are the eigenenergies.

        Now, for the specific problem that  we are solving the system is described
        by two deep wells $v^{L}(x)$ and $v^{R}(x)$, where $L$ and $R$ are labels
        for the left and right well respectively.
        The wells will be so deep that there will be no tunneling over the
        barrier in the bound states that we will use for our single-particle
        basis.
        Furthermore, the Coulomb repulsion will be strong enough to ensure that
        we will not see any two-body eigenstates with two particles in one of
        the wells for the energy levels that we are interested in.
        % TODO: We will not see these states for the distinguishable model
        % as we force one particle to be in each well.
        % TODO: Add comment on singlet and triplet states being degenerate,
        % thus making spin redudant.
        This makes the system split up into two distinguishable subsystems
        that we label $L$ and $R$ with one particle in each subsystem.
        In order to distinguish these systems from one another in the
        two-particle picture we will construct two disjoint single-particle
        basis sets $\qty{\phi^{L}_{i}}_{i = 1}^{N^L}$ and
        $\qty{\phi^{R}_{i}}_{i = 1}^{N^R}$, where
        $\braket{\phi^{A}_{i}}{\phi^{B}_{j}} = \delta^{AB} \delta_{ij}$
        \footnote{
            It is worth pointing out that we will not see any products
            between states in different wells.
            We can in this problem think of the two basis sets as living in
            two different Hilbert spaces as would be done for e.g., the
            Jaynes-Cummings systems where there are no overlap elements
            between the photonic and the electronic states.
        }.
        % TODO: Are the single-particle basis states the computational basis
        % elements?
        Using the finite-difference approach described above we can set up this
        basis in two different ways.
        The first is to diagonalize the full one-body Hamiltonian
        \begin{align*}
            h(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \dv[2]{}{x} + v^{L}(x) + v^{R}(x),
        \end{align*}
        and then sort the eigenstates by which well they are localized in.
        To do this we can compute the center of mass of the single-particle
        wave function and see where it is centered.
        % TODO: Maybe include a plot of this? Optionally in a supplementary
        % materials.
        The drawback when using this method is that we must include a large
        number of basis states when the wells are far detuned.
        This is because the eigenstates with the lowest eigenvalue are best
        described.
        Therefore, to localize states in the highest energy well will require
        very high energy states.
        % TODO: Discuss this fact a little more. It can also be enough to
        % demonstrate that the we need a lot of grid points to construct the
        % eigenstates in one of the wells properly.

        The second approach is to \emph{a priori} determine that the
        eigenstates will split up into two disjoint sets, where
        $v^{L}(x) \phi^{R}(x) = v^{R}(x) \phi^{L}(x) = 0$.
        % TODO: This condition should be tested explicitly.
        % TODO: Add a plot of this.
        We can then construct two one-body Hamiltonian operators given
        by
        \begin{align*}
            h^{A}(x) \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \dv[2]{}{x} + v^{A}(x),
        \end{align*}
        that we can separately diagonalize, and construct a set of
        single-particle eigenpairs for each well.
        For the potential wells we describe both approaches will give the
        same eigenpairs to numerical precision.
        % TODO: This should be backed up, and formulated a little differently.
        % Perhaps included in a supplemental material?
        The two sets of matrix elements for the one-body Hamiltonian will
        then be
        \begin{align*}
            h^{A}_{ij}
            \equiv \mel*{\phi^A_i}{\hat{h}^A}{\phi^A_j}
            = \delta_{ij} \epsilon^{A}_j,
        \end{align*}
        where $\epsilon^A_i$ are the eigenenergies of $\hat{h}^A$.
        We then have that $\braket*{\phi^A_i}{\phi^B_j} = \delta^{AB}
        \delta_{ij}$ as the two sets of basis states are so far removed
        that they share no overlap (hence, $\delta^{AB}$), and as they
        are eigenstates (hence, $\delta_{ij}$).


    \subsection{Describing the two-body problem}
        Due to there only being two particles we will solve the full problem
        using exact diagonalization \footnote{
            By ``exact'' we here mean that the solution is exact within the
            truncated, approximate, finite-difference basis set.
        }, often denoted the \emph{full configuration interaction} method
        in electronic structure theory \cite{the-pink-book}.
        The wave function ansatz is then given by
        \begin{align}
            \ket*{\Phi_I}
            &= \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R} C_{kl, I}
            \ket*{\phi^{L}_k \phi^{R}_l},
            \label{eq:wave-function-ansatz}
        \end{align}
        where no symmetry is assumed for the wave function, and the index
        $I = (i, j)$ is a compound index denoting the excited two-body
        state we are looking at.
        We denote the two-particle product state as $\ket*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}
        \equiv \ket*{\phi^L_i} \otimes \ket*{\phi^R_j}$.
        There will be a total of $N^L N^R$ eigenstates $\ket*{\Phi_I}$.
        We adopt the notation $\bra*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}
        = \bra*{\phi^L_i} \otimes \bra*{\phi^R_j}
        \equiv \ket*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}^{\dagger}$.
        This should be contrasted with the conventional way of doing full
        configuration interaction in electronic structure theory by using
        a linear combination of Slater determinants as the electrons are
        indistinguishable \cite{the-pink-book}.

        For the full many-body system we need the matrix elements of the
        soft-Coulomb interaction operator $u(x_1, x_2)$ from
        equation \eqref{eq:soft-coulomb}.
        As we are using a finite-difference basis set, we will compute the matrix
        elements using numerical integration.
        That is, we compute the matrix elements
        \begin{align}
            u_{ij, kl}
            &\equiv \mel*{\phi^L_i\phi^R_j}{\hat{u}}{\phi^L_k\phi^R_l}
            \\
            &= \int\dd{x_1} \dd{x_2}
            {\phi^L_i}^{*}(x_1) {\phi^R_j}^{*}(x_2)
            \nonumber \\
            &\qquad
            \times
            u(x_1, x_2)
            \phi^L_k(x_1)\phi^R_l(x_2),
            \label{eq:two-body-coulomb}
        \end{align}
        by the use of the trapezoidal rule integrating over $x_2$ first.
        This entails to constructing the matrix elements $W_{ij}(x)$
        given by
        \begin{align*}
            W_{ij}(x)
            = \int \dd{y} {\phi^R_i}^{*}(y) u(x, y) \phi^R_j(y),
        \end{align*}
        and use this to compute the two-body matrix elements from
        \begin{align*}
            u_{ij, kl}
            = \int \dd{x_1} {\phi^{L}_{i}}^{*}(x_1)
            W_{jl}(x_1) \phi^L_k(x_1),
        \end{align*}
        where we note in passing that all the single-particle eigenstates
        are real.
        Furthermore, the choice of constructing $W_{ij}(x)$ by integrating
        first over $x_2$, i.e., the right well, is completely arbitrary.
        Integrating over the left well first, and then the right well gives
        exactly the same matrix elements $u_{ij, kl}$ due to the symmetry
        of the Coulomb interaction.

        Inserting the wave function ansatz into the time-independent Schrödinger
        equation, and projecting onto a two-body state
        $\bra*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}$ we get
        \begin{align*}
            \mel*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{\hat{H}}{\Phi_K}
             % &= \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R}
             % \mel*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{\hat{H}}{\phi^L_k \phi^R_l}
             % C_{kl, K}
             % \\
            &= % \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R}
            H_{ij, kl} C_{kl, K}
            = S_{ij, kl} C_{kl, K} E_{K},
        \end{align*}
        where $H_{ij, kl} \equiv \mel*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{\hat{H}}{
        \phi^L_k \phi^R_l}$ are the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in
        the product basis, and $S_{ij, kl} = \braket*{
        \phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{\phi^L_k \phi^R_l} = \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl}$ are
        the overlap matrix elements between two two-body states.
        Solving this generalized eigenvalue equation gives us the
        coefficients $C_{ij, K}$ where the columns correspond to the
        eigenstates $\ket*{\Phi_K}$, and the eigenenergies $E_K$.
        As discussed in the previous section we know that the one-body Hamiltonian
        will split up into two disjoint operators; one for the left-well and the
        other for the right-well.
        We can write the one-body Hamiltonian as $\hat{h} = \hat{h}^L \otimes \hat{1}
        + \hat{1} \otimes \hat{h}^{R}$.
        From the orthonormality of the two sets of eigenstates we get
        \begin{align}
            h_{ij, kl}
            &= \mel*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{\hat{h}}{\phi^L_k \phi^R_l}
            % \\
            % &= \mel*{\phi^{L}_i}{\hat{h}^L}{\phi^L_k}
            % \braket*{\phi^R_j}{\phi^R_l}
            % + \braket*{\phi^L_i}{\phi^L_k}
            % \mel*{\phi^R_j}{\hat{h}^R}{\phi^{R}_l}
            % \\
            % &=
            % \delta_{ik} \epsilon^{L}_k
            % \delta_{jl}
            % + \delta_{ik}
            % \delta_{jl} \epsilon^{R}_l
            = \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl} \qty(
                \epsilon^L_k
                + \epsilon^{R}_l
            ).
            \label{eq:one-body-hamiltonian}
        \end{align}
        From the matrix elements of the one-body Hamiltonian in
        \eqref{eq:one-body-hamiltonian} and the Coulomb operator
        \eqref{eq:two-body-coulomb} we can construct the full Hamiltonian
        to be $H_{ij, kl} = h_{ij, kl} + u_{ij, kl}$.
        We then proceed to diagonalize the matrix, and find the coefficients
        $C_{kl, K}$ and the corresponding eigenenergies $E_K$.

    \subsection{Spin considerations}
        % TODO: Consider moving this higher up, and maybe not as a subsection
        We have so far in this discussion ignored the spin component of the electrons.
        As we are considering two electrons we expect to see singlet and triplet
        configurations for the total wave function.
        The Hamiltonian is spin-independent and we can therefore limit our attention
        to the spatial components of the wave functions.
        % TODO: Add reference to the lack of spin interactions in the liquid helium
        % system?
        Furthermore, as the system is described by a double-well with a separate
        spatial basis for each well, we know that the singlet and the triplet states
        will be degenerate for all states where there is one particle in each well
        (which is the only case we consider in this work),
        and we can fully factorize out the spin-part of the problem.


    \subsection{Measuring the degree of entanglement}
        % TODO: Why do we need entanglement?
        % Add reference to the quantum computing books.
        As we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian and found the energy spectrum, we
        in principle have all the knowledge that can be obtained from the system.
        We also work in a zero-temperature regime with no noise from the outside
        world.
        This lets us create a pure state from the two-particle wave function.
        % TODO: Which states are we interested in measuring entanglement for?

        For a given two-body pure state $\ket*{\Phi}$ we can construct the
        corresponding density operator
        \begin{align*}
            \hat{\rho} = \dyad*{\Phi}{\Phi}
            = \sum_{i, k = 1}^{N^L}
            \sum_{j, l = 1}^{N^R}
            C_{ij} C^{*}_{kl} \dyad*{\phi^L_i \phi^R_j}{
                \phi^L_k \phi^R_l
            },
        \end{align*}
        where $C_{ij}$ are the coefficients \footnote{
            Note that these coefficients are not necessarily the eigenstates
            of the full two-body Hamiltonian.
            We are free to choose whatever state we wish as long as the states
            are normalized.
        }.
        A measure of entanglement can be achieved from the von Neumann entropy.
        We then need to construct the reduced density operators for each
        subsystem $L$ and $R$.
        They are given by
        \begin{gather*}
            \hat{\rho}^L
            = \tr_R \! \qty(\hat{\rho})
            = \sum_{i, k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{j = 1}^{N^R}
            C_{ij} C^{*}_{kj} \dyad*{\phi^L_i}{\phi^L_k},
            \\
            \hat{\rho}^R
            = \tr_{L} \! \qty(\hat{\rho})
            = \sum_{i = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{j, l = 1}^{N^R}
            C_{ij} C^{*}_{il} \dyad*{\phi^R_j}{\phi^R_l},
        \end{gather*}
        where we have used that the single-particle states in each well are
        orthonormal.
        As the total state is a pure state, we know that the reduced density
        operators must have the same spectrum (the von Neumann entropies must
        cancel perfectly).
        In the case where there are indistinguishable particles the one-body
        density can be used as a replacement for the reduced density matrices
        of the two subsystems.
        We can construct the one-body density operator from $\hat{\rho}^1
        = \hat{\rho}^L + \hat{\rho}^R$.


        
        % TODO: Describe how measurement is performed using the reduced density
        % operators.
        % We can compute the expectation value of the energy in the subsystems.
        % TODO: Describe the avoided crossing


    \subsection{Constructing the computational basis states}
        When working with quantum computers we need a set of computational
        basis states, commonly denoted $\ket*{0}$ and $\ket*{1}$.
        In a two-qubit quantum computer we wish to get the four computational
        basis states $\ket*{00}$, $\ket*{01}$, $\ket*{10}$, and $\ket*{11}$,
        where $\ket*{ij} = \ket*{i} \otimes \ket*{j}$ denotes product states.
        From the discussion above it is tempting to choose the two lowest
        single-particle states $\ket*{\phi^{A}_i}$ in each well as our
        computational basis states.
        These are, however, not good approximations to the "true" computational
        basis states in the interacting case.
        Granted, the states are separable in each well, but the two-body
        wave function $\ket*{\Phi_I}$ will in general not be a product state
        of the single-particle states.
        This means that the computational basis states will be represented by
        the reduced density operators $\hat{\rho}^L_I$ and $\hat{\rho}^R_I$,
        where $I$ denotes the two-body wave function $\ket*{\Phi_I}$ such that
        $\hat{\rho}_I = \dyad*{\Phi_I}{\Phi_I}$.
        In principle we could construct a single-particle basis from these
        reduced density operators, viz.,
        \begin{align*}
            \hat{\rho}^A_i \ket*{\psi^A_i}
            = \lambda^A_i \ket*{\psi^A_i},
        \end{align*}
        where $\qty{\ket*{\psi^A_i}}_{i = 1}^{N^A}$ would be the single-particle
        states that most resemble the ``true'' computational basis states,
        and the eigenvalues $\lambda^A_i$ represent their occupation
        in the given two-body eigenstate $\ket*{\Phi_I}$ \footnote{
            These states closely resembles the \emph{natural orbitals}
            found by diagonalizing the one-body density operator $\hat{\rho}^1$.
            % TODO: Cite papers by Löwdin if this should be included.
        }.
        These states are related to the Schmidt decomposition in that the
        Schmidt decomposition gives single-particle states that diagonalize
        the reduced density matrices.
        % TODO: Rewrite this section using the Schmidt decomposition, and show
        % that the Schmidt states diagonalize the reduced density operators.
 
\section{Operational regimes}
    In this project we have been looking for well configurations corresponding to three different types of interaction between the qubits. In configuration I the qubits are detuned, whereas configuration II and III corresponds to avoided level crossings between two ($E_{01}, E_{10}$) and three ($E_{11}, E_{20}, E_{02}$) energy levels respectively. The qubit interaction within these different well configurations will be discussed in detail below. Adiabatic transitions between the different configurations can be achieved by parameterizing the well voltages according to
    %They are the \emph{measuring regime}, the \emph{double-avoided
    %crossing regime}, and the \emph{triple-avoided crossing regime}.
    % TODO: Find better names for the different regimes.
    % Especially for the double- and triple-avoided cases.
    % To alter the wells we have to tune all seven anodes, and exactly
    % how these are dialed will be discussed in detail below.
    % Conceptually we are seeking three a parameterization $\zeta$
    % such that $\hat{H}(\zeta)$ gives the Hamiltonian for a given
    % set of anodes.
    % We will denote the three different regimes by $\zeta_m$ for the
    % measuring regime, $\zeta_d$ for the double-avoided crossing, and
    % $\zeta_t$ for the triple-avoided crossing.
    % These regimes will be adiabatically connected,
    % % TODO: Define adiabatically connected
    % and we construct a linear interpolation between the three regimes.
    \begin{align}
        \vb*{V}(\zeta) = (1-\zeta)\vb*{V}_\mathrm{I} + \zeta\vb*{V}_\mathrm{III},
        \label{eq:well-parameterization}
    \end{align}
    where $\vb*{V}_\mathrm{I}$ are the electrode voltages for configuration I and $\vb*{V}_\mathrm{III}$ are the electrode voltages for configuration III. Configuration II is obtained with voltages $\vb*{V}_\mathrm{II} = \vb*{V}(\zeta_\mathrm{II})$ for some $\zeta_\mathrm{II}\in(0,1)$.
    That is, configuration II is found on the path from configuration I to configuration III.
    %Should maybe be write the actual value of \zeta instead?

    As we are looking at the spectrum for every configuration $\zeta$, we will denote
    the eigenstates by $\ket*{\Phi_I(\zeta)}$.
    Correspondingly, there is a $\zeta$-dependence in the single-particle states
    $\ket*{\phi^{A}_i}$, and the Schmidt states $\ket*{\psi^{A}_i}$.

    \subsection{Configuration I}
        % This regime is supposed to make the two-body wave function
        % into a separable wave function in the single-particle basis,
        % and a product state in the natural orbital basis.
        % A large detuning, i.e., large difference in the excitation energy,
        % in each subsystem ensures that no entanglement will occur.
        % % TODO: Are there works that can be cited on this?
        % % Or is it possible to show for some model system?
        % In this regime we are looking for two-body states that have zero
        % entropy.
        % This means that the eigenstates can be written as
        % \begin{align*}
        %     \ket*{\Psi_I}
        %     % &= \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R} C_{kl, I}
        %     % \ket*{\phi^{L}_k \phi^{R}_l}
        %     = \qty(
        %         \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L}
        %         d^L_{k, I} \ket*{\phi^L_k}
        %     ) \otimes \qty(
        %         \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R}
        %         d^R_{l, I} \ket*{\phi^R_l}
        %     )
        %     = \ket*{\xi^L_I \xi^{R}_I},
        % \end{align*}
        % where in this case the coefficient matrix from
        % Eq.~\ref{eq:wave-function-ansatz} splits up into two
        % disjoint vectors.
        % % TODO: That is, there is no mixing between the states.
        % % This can be written way more smoothly.
        % In the last equation we have inserted the natural orbitals, or
        % Schmidt basis for this separable wave function.
        % This turns then into a product state, and by definition we thus
        % see that there is no entropy.

        The purpose of this well configuration is to allow measurements and gates acting on one qubit without affecting the state of the other qubit. This requires that the two-body wave function is separable in the single-particle basis, or equivalently a product state in the natural orbital basis, i.e. the eigenstates can be written as
        \begin{align*}
            \ket{\Phi_I(\zeta_I)}
            % &= \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R} C_{kl, I}
            % \ket*{\phi^{L}_k \phi^{R}_l}
            % &= \qty(
            %     \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L}
            %     d^L_{k, I} \ket{\phi^L_k}
            % ) \otimes \qty(
            %     \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R}
            %     d^R_{l, I} \ket{\phi^R_l}
            % )
            % \\
            = \sum_{k = 1}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 1}^{N^R}
            d^L_{k, I} d^{R}_{l, I}
            \ket{\phi^L_k \phi^R_l}
            = \ket{\psi^L_I \psi^{R}_I},
        \end{align*}
        % This equation might be better placed in the section on the Schmidt basis/natural basis.
        % See if it fits better there when that section is written.
        where $\ket*{\psi^L_I}, \ket*{\psi^R_I}$ denotes the natural orbitals, or
        Schmidt basis, for the separable wave function. By definition this is a product state and thus the entropy is zero. To achieve this property of the wave function, we target a well configuration with large qubit detuning, i.e. a large difference in excitation energy for each subsystem. This ensures that no entanglement occurs.  % TODO: Are there works that can be cited on this?
        % Or is it possible to show for some model system?


    \subsection{Configuration II}
        % The second regime is the double-avoided crossing regime and is
        % meant to be used for an entangling two-qubit gate.
        % We wish to adiabatically continue the $\ket*{01}$- and
        % $\ket*{10}$-states (as seen in the measuring regime) to the
        % point where they are closest in energy.
        % % TODO: Describe "adiabatically continue", or find better word.
        % Here the difference in energy will be so small making the two
        % states entangle.
        % % TODO: Explain why this occurs.
        % The idea is therefore to create a parameterization of the voltages
        % in the potential wells that will take the states from the measuring
        % regime and to the double-avoided crossing regime where only
        % the $\ket*{01}$ and $\ket*{10}$ will mix.
        In the second well configuration we target an avoided crossing between the $\ket*{01}$ and
        $\ket*{10}$ state, which is meant to be used for an entangling two-qubit gate. When moving from configuration I into the avoided crossing of configuration II infinitely slow, the probability of a transition from the $\ket*{01}$ to the $\ket*{10}$ state is zero according to the adiabatic theorem. An infinitely fast shift in configuration will instead cause the transition probability to be 1. Changing configuration $\vb*{V}(\zeta)$ with a finite speed $\dv{\zeta}{t}$ will thus result in a transition probability between one and zero, and hence an entangled state. %Should this be explained in some other way? Is an explanation even needed?
        In our system we have that logical states $\ket*{01}$ and $\ket*{10}$ correspond
        to the two first excited states $\ket*{\Phi_1(\zeta_{II})}$ and
        $\ket*{\Phi_2(\zeta_{II})}$.
        
    % \subsection{Triple-avoided crossing regime}
    %     The last regime concerns the so-called triple-avoided crossing
    %     point \cite{triple-avoided-crossing}.
    %     There are two reasons to include this regime.
    %     % TODO: Are there really two reasons, or just the one?
    %     Firstly, when moving from the measuring regime to the double-avoided
    %     crossing point we do not want any of the other computational states
    %     to mix with each other or leak to higher excited states.
    %     Creating a triple-avoided crossing point for the $\ket*{11}$,
    %     $\ket*{02}$ and $\ket*{20}$-states removes a factor of noise
    %     in this case, as we can place the triple-avoided crossing point
    %     after the double-avoided crossing point
    %     \cite{triple-avoided-crossing}.
    %     % TODO: Try to give a more visual explanation of this:
    %     % (measuring $\to$ double-avoided $\to$ triple-avoided)
    %     Secondly, we wish to included an extra gate.
    %     % TODO: This must be understood.
    %     % See the triple-avoided-crossing paper.
    %     The $ZZ$ coupling strength is given by $\zeta = E_{11}-E_{01}-E_{10}$. %TODO: Write about this?

    \subsection{Configuration III}
        The last configuration corresponds to coinciding avoided crossings between the three double excitation energy levels $E_{11}, E_{20}$ and $E_{02}$, i.e. a triple degeneracy point. There are two reasons to include this configuration in our well parameterization. The first is that the triple degeneracy yields a high $ZZ$-coupling, which allows for faster execution of controlled phase gates such as the CZ gate. The second reason is to separate the avoided crossings of the double excitation energy levels from the crossing of the single excitation states (configuration II), as seen in see figure ?. This separation reduces the parasitic $ZZ$-coupling in configuration II and therefore improve the performance of the entangling gates that we aim to realize in that configuration \cite{triple-avoided-crossing}. 
    


\section{Numerical implementation}

    \subsection{Finding optimal well configurations}
        % Jonas and Stian describe how the double and triple avoided crossings were found.
        % Include a discussion on the far-detuned situation.
        
        The ultimate goal of our work here is to control the liquid helium double well system in such a way that it behaves as a two-qubit quantum computer. At our disposal are the voltages $\boldsymbol{V}=[V_1,V_2,\cdots,V_7]$ of the seven electrodes described in section \ref{sec:device}, as well as electromagnetic pulses from the resonator described in the same section. The voltages affect the overall shape of the double well potential through \eqref{eq:trap}, so we refer to a specific set of voltages $\boldsymbol{V}$ as a \textit{well configuration}. In this section, we present a way of finding optimal configurations for one-qubit operations, as well as optimal configurations for two-qubit operations.
        
        An optimal well configuration for doing one-qubit operations, that is, operations on each individual well, is a configuration for which the wells have distinct excitation frequencies. The resonator can then interact with each well through photons of its specific frequency. Since the frequency of each well depends mainly on the curvature at the bottom of the well,\may{[ref?]} we want to adjust the curvatures of each well so that the frequencies are distinct, but at the same time within the resonator working range of 5 to 15 GHz.\may{[ref]} In order to adjust the curvatures directly, 
        an inversion program was implemented, which, given 7 constraints on the potential $V(x)$ and its derivatives, returns the 7 required voltages $\boldsymbol{V}$ on the electrodes.\may{[link to folder]} \may{[Add equations to elaborate on this?]} To pin down the desired overall shape of a double well, 3 constraints had to be spent on the depths of each well and the depth of the well divide in the middle of the device. 2 further constraints were used to ensure a slope of zero at the bottom points of each well, leaving the last 2 constraints to control the curvature at the bottom points. Using this inversion program, we were able to find a configuration for which the wells are detuned within the resonator working range, while keeping the entanglement of each energy state low and the voltages below magnitudes which would lead to electric breakdown between the electrodes or from the helium surface to the electrodes. This configuration, from here on refered to as the \textit{detuned configuration} is further described and discussed in section \ref{sec:results}.
        
        %rewrite indexes from eigenstate 0,1,2, etc instead of 00, 01, 10, 11.
        Having found the voltages for the detuned configuration, we want to go from this configuration to a double avoided crossing. In order to do this, we want the computational basis states $\rho_{10}(\boldsymbol{V})$ and $\rho_{01}(\boldsymbol{V})$ to become entangled, while the entanglement between the other computational basis states remain as small as possible. Note that we have now written down the dependence of the states on the voltages $\boldsymbol{V}$ explicitly, as these are the only parameters that should be varied to generate the entanglement. As a measure of entanglement, we use the entanglement entropy given by
        \begin{align*}
            S_{ij}(\boldsymbol{V}) = -\Tr{\Tr_R{\rho_{ij}(\boldsymbol{V})}\log_2[\Tr_R{\rho_{ij}(\boldsymbol{V})]}},
        \end{align*}
        where the subscripts $ij$ denotes which computational basis state we wish to calculate the entanglement entropy for. We arbitrarily chose to trace over subsystem $R$.
        A possible configuration for the double avoided crossing might be determined by the voltages that constitute a local or global minima of the following cost function
        \begin{align*}
            C(\boldsymbol{V}) =& -\alpha S_{01}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &- \alpha S_{10}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{00}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{20}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{11}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{02}(\boldsymbol{V}),
        \end{align*}
        where $\alpha > 0$ is a hyperparameter that decides the weight of the first two terms. To motivate the use of this function, notice that the terms $-\alpha S_{01}(\boldsymbol{V})$ and $-\alpha S_{10}(\boldsymbol{V})$ is minimized when the entanglement entropy of $\rho_{01}$ and $\rho_{10}$ is maximized, respectively. Also, $S_{00}(\boldsymbol{V})$, $S_{20}(\boldsymbol{V})$, $S_{11}(\boldsymbol{V})$ and $S_{02}(\boldsymbol{V})$ is minimized when the entanglement entropy of $\rho_{00}$, $\rho_{20}$, $\rho_{11}$ and $\rho_{02}$ is minimized, respectively. We did not include the entanglement entropy of any of the higher energy states as these will not be used for computations. To minimize $C(\boldsymbol{V})$ we evaluate its gradient wrt. the voltages, that is,
        $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{V}}C(\boldsymbol{V})$, using the Pytorch machine learning library \may{[ref]}. We then use a variation of gradient descent, Adam \may{[ref]} to update the voltages.
        
        For the triple avoided crossing, one possible cost function can be defined as
        \begin{align*}
            C(\boldsymbol{V}) =& -\alpha S_{20}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &- \alpha S_{11}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &- \alpha S_{02}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{00}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{01}(\boldsymbol{V}) \notag \\
            &+ S_{10}(\boldsymbol{V}).
        \end{align*}
        The voltages are then updated in a similar fashion as with the double avoided crossing case.
