\section{Introduction} % Morten + Johannes + Niyaz
Entanglement is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation. In fact, the generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing, including superconducting circuits~\cite{Steffen1423}, tapped ions~\cite{}, semiconductor quantum dots~\cite{Li809}, color-center defects in diamond~\cite{}, and neutral atoms in optical lattices~\cite{Saffman1010} just to name a few.

\textcolor{blue}{JP will work on this paragraph}Technological advances in QIS, particularly in superconducting qubit and trapped ion experiments, have also created the opportunity to explore the generation of entanglement in emerging QIS systems based on trapped electrons~{}. Some statement of why one would like this kind of thing. Faster electron chain phonons, no screening, so very strong Coloumb interactions. paradigm for studying the role of entanglement produced purely by the Coloumb interaction and what kinds of entanglement protocols are possible.

The system of electrons on helium is quantum non-degenerate, the system parameters that are achievable 

This could also be a platform to investigate the crossover from purely classical to quantum mechanical representation of the system of electrons on helium. 

Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol schemes for two-qubit logic. In a superconducting circuits the interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling between circuit element or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange interaction~\cite{blais2020circuit}. This allow to implement various schemes for entanglement, such as $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gate~\cite{bialczak2010quantum}, controlled-phase gate~\cite{dicarlo2009demonstration}, resonator-induced phase gate~\cite{paik2016experimental}, cross-resonance gate~\cite{chow2011simple} etc. Entanglement gates in trapped ions are produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used for transferring excitations between ion qubits~\cite{cirac1995quantum}. This has been experimentally demonstrated by implementing Cirac-Zoller gate~\cite{turchette1998deterministic}, Leibfried’s geometric-phase gate~\cite{leibfried2003experimental} etc. In photonic quantum computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded into waveguides~\cite{bartlett2020universal}. Two-qubit gates in semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange interactions~\cite{brunner2011two,watson2018programmable} or generated by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit interaction~\cite{borjans2020resonant}.

In the system of charge qubits one can generate entanglement via Coulomb interaction, where state-dependent charge configuration in one qubit impose different electric fields on the other qubit. \textit{discuss several examples, working on it, Niyaz}

Coulomb interaction governed entanglement naturally can be realized in the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of different electrons do not overlap. This results in a strong exchange free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the electrons~\cite{dykman2003qubits}. The lack of disorder in the systems also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest to the system as a candidate for quantum information processing~\cite{platzman1999quantum,lyon2006spin,schuster2010proposal}. Advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques have opened the door for the study of electrons on helium in confined geometries and mesoscopic devices. Single-electron detection has been experimentally achieved~\cite{glasson2005trapping,koolstra2019coupling} along with stable, high-fidelity, electron transfer along a gated CCD array~\cite{bradbury2011efficient}. Filamentation of electron current was observed in helium-filled microchannels along with electron crystallization and ``slip-stick'' dynamics of the Wigner solid~\cite{glasson2001observation,rees2016structural,rees2016stick}, where strong Coulomb interactions driven many-body phenomena were explored.


Electrons on helium is another qubit platform. Here 2 qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner.

The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange process between two charge particles according to quantum electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges generating quantum entanglement.

Understanding the behavior of strongly confined electrons is of fundamental
interest for solving many-body problems.  Quantum dots, e.g. electrons
confined in semiconducting heterostructures, are of particular interest since
they exhibit, due to their small size, discrete quantum levels.  Under these
conditions, typical quantum phenomena like tunneling, entanglement and
magnetization can all be observed.   Since quantum
dots are manufactured and designed artificially at the laboratory, their
quantum levels can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the external field or the
size and shape of the system.  As a consequence, quantum dots provide a high
level of control for the dynamics and correlation of the electrons, which
makes them perfectly suited to study quantum effects in practice.  Since their
ground state shows similar shell structures and magic numbers as seen for
atoms and nuclei, these systems give the opportunity to
study electronic systems without the presence of a nucleus affecting the
electrons.  Apart from their relevance for theoretical research in quantum
physics, quantum dots offer a wide variety of applications: In particular,
their electrical and optical properties make them attractive for the use in
laser technology \cite{strauf2010,5075760} and solar cells
\cite{jenks:013111,doi:10.1021/cr900289f}, but they are also used in quantum
computers\cite{PhysRevA.57.120} and medical imaging \cite{Ben-Ari02042003}.


Our work's place in this field

%Electrons on helium represent a promising platform for investigating strongly-coupled qubits. Therefore a systematic investigation of the controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is of significant importance for quantum information processing using trapped electrons.

\section{Sample, geometry considerations} % Niyaz writes this
%general information about electrons on helium
Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface, which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of vacuum. The weak interaction with enviorment, which is mainly governed by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for any qubit platform. SSE's in-plane motion can be further localized by using microdevices on the length scales approaching the interelectron separation (at the order of one micron).

\section{Computational Methods} % Hakon, Oyvind
    As we are only studying a model comprised of two electrons restricted to move in a
    one-dimensional external potential we have employed the
    \emph{ab-initio} method configuration-interaction to compute the steady-state
    properties of the system.
    We have used a static, one-dimensional, grid-based basis set for the single-particle
    functions.
    This allows for flexibility in the choice of the external potential, and fits the
    interpolated potential particularly well.
    
    \subsection{The Hamiltonian}
    The Hamiltonian of $N$ interacting electrons confined by some potential $v(\vb{r})$ can be written on general form 
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 + v(\vb{r}_i) \right) + \sum_{i < j} \hat{u}(r_i, r_j),
    \end{equation}
    where $\hat{u}(i,j)$ is the electron-electron (Coulomb) interaction. 
    
    Many-body methods are commonly written in second-quantized form where the Hamiltonian takes the form 
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{H} = \sum_{pq} \mel{\psi_p}{\hat{h}}{\psi_q}\hat{a}_p^\dagger \hat{a}_q + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs} \mel{\psi_p \psi_q}{\hat{u}}{\psi_r \psi_s} \hat{a}_p^\dagger \hat{a}_q^\dagger \hat{a}_s \hat{a_r},
    \end{equation}
    where $a_p^\dagger$ and $a_p$ are creation and annihilation operators associated with the single-particle function $\ket{\psi_p}$.
    
    We consider a one-dimensional model where the confining potential is parametrized/obtained from finite element calculations, see \ref{fig3}. 
    
    The bare Coulomb interaction is divergent in 1D (REF) and it is customary to use a smoothed Coulomb interaction~\cite{su-coulomb} given by 
    \begin{align}
        u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
    \end{align}
    where $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction and $a$ removes
    the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.
    
    The single-particle functions (qubit states is a possible name here) are chosen as the eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian
    \begin{equation}
        \left( -\dv[2]{}{x}+v(x) \right) \psi_p(x) = \epsilon_p \psi_p(x).
    \end{equation}
    
    It should be noted that this implies that Slater determinants built from the single-particle are eigenfunctions of the non-interacting many-body Hamiltonian
    \begin{equation}
     \left( \sum_{i=1}^N -\frac{1}{2}\laplacian_i + v(\vb{r}_i)  \right) \ket{\Phi_p} = E_p \ket{\Phi_p},
    \end{equation}
    where $\ket{\Phi_p} = \ket{\psi_{p_1}\cdots \psi_{p_N}}$ and 
    \begin{equation}
        E_p = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_{p_i}.
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item interaction with EM field
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Finite difference basis set}
        The time-independent one-dimensional system can be described by the one-body
        Hamiltonian
        \begin{align}
            h(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\dv[2]{}{x}
            + v(x),
        \end{align}
        where the external potential $v(x)$ is an arbitrary function of the grid $x$.
        We proceed by discretizing the grid and use the second-order central differences
        method for the double-derivative.
        Building a tridiagonal matrix from the grid points, we solve the eigenvalue
        equation and choose the $l$ first eigenstates (i.e., the eigenstates with the
        lowest eigenenergy) as the single-particle basis $\{\psi_i\}_{i = 1}^l$.
        This means that $\braket{\psi_i}{\psi_j} = \delta_{ij}$ and we have
        the matrix elements
        \begin{align}
            h_{ij} \equiv \mel{\psi_i}{\hat{h}}{\psi_j}
            = \delta_{ij}\varepsilon_j,
        \end{align}
        where no summation is implied, and $\varepsilon_j$ is the eigenenergy of
        $\psi_j$ for $h(x)$.

        For the full many-body system we need the matrix elements of the Coulomb
        interaction operator
        \begin{align}
            u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{\abs{x_1 - x_2}},
        \end{align}
        however this operator is divergent, both analytically and numerically.
        To get around this we introduce the shielded Coulomb operator \cite{su-coulomb}
        \begin{align}
            u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
        \end{align}
        where $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction and $a$ removes
        the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.
        % TODO: We should discuss the values of alpha and a, especially in the
        % dimensionless setting.
        We compute the matrix elements of $u(x_1, x_2)$ by numerical integration.
        That is, we compute the matrix elements
        \begin{align}
            u^{ij}_{kl}
            &\equiv \mel{\psi_i\psi_j}{\hat{u}}{\psi_k\psi_l}
            \\
            &= \int\dd x_1 \dd x_2
            \psi_i^{*}(x_1)\psi_j^{*}(x_2)u(x_1, x_2)
            \psi_k(x_1)\psi_l(x_2),
        \end{align}
        by the use of the trapezoidal rule integrating over $x_2$ first.
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Dimensional scaling.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Full configuration-interaction method}
        Having set up the matrix elements for the one-body Hamiltonian $h(x)$ and the
        two-body shielded Coulomb interaction $u(x_1, x_2)$ we build a fermionic
        many-body basis from Slater determinants.
        This ensures that the many-body wave function is antisymmetric with regards to
        particle exchange as dictated by the Pauli principle.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Second quantized Hamiltonian.
            \item Slater determinants $\to$ Anti-symmetrized many-body state.
                Eigenfunctions of the non-interacting Hamiltonian.
            \item Configuration-interaction ansatz, formally exact in the given basis.
        \end{enumerate}

\section{\label{sec:level1}Problem: Many-level system interacting with EM field}

We start with the following problem in general form: we have a quantum-mechanical system described with Hamiltonian $H_0$ and states $\ket{n}$ being eigenfunctions of $H_0$.
\begin{equation*}
H_0 \ket{n} = E_n \ket{n}
\end{equation*}
We would like to know how these states evolve in time in the presence of a time-varying electric field. The interaction of quantum systems with electric fields is described by the Hamiltonian $ H_i = - \vb{E}(t) \vb{d}$, where $\vb{E}(t) = \vb{\mathcal{E}}_0 \cos \omega t$ and $\vb{d}$ is the dipole moment of the quantum system. Note, here we use dipole approximation (wavelength of the EM field is much larger than characteristic size of the quantum system wavefunction). The evolution of the quantum wavefunction is governed by Schrodinger equation:
\begin{equation}
 i \dot{\psi} = H \psi
\label{eq1}.
\end{equation}
where $H = H_0 + H_i$ (note, $\hbar = 1$). We seek the solution in the form $\psi(t) = \sum_n C_n(t) e^{-i E_n t}$. We evolve this solution through Eq.~\ref{eq1} and get the following answer:
\begin{equation}
 i \dot{C_m} = -\frac{1}{2} \vb{\mathcal{E}}_0 \sum_{\alpha} \sum_{n} C_n e^{i \omega_{mn} t + i \alpha \omega t} \vb{d}_{mn}
\label{eq2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \braket{m}{n} = \delta_{mn}, \mel{m}{\vb{d}}{n} = \vb{d}_{mn}, E_m - E_n = \omega_{mn}
\end{equation}
Here we used $\cos \omega t = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha = \pm} e^{i \alpha \omega t}$. Lets assume the system is in the ground state at $t = 0$, so $C_n(0) = \delta_{n1}$. We integrate Eq.~\ref{eq2} and get an expression:
\begin{equation}
 C_m = \frac{i}{2} \vb{\mathcal{E}}_0 \sum_{\alpha} \vb{d}_{m1} \frac{e^{i (\omega_{mn} + \alpha \omega) t} - 1}{i (\omega_{m1} + \alpha \omega)} 
\label{eq3}.
\end{equation}
An important condition here is:
\begin{equation}
\abs{\frac{\vb{\mathcal{E}}_0 \vb{d}_{m1}}{\omega_{m1} \pm \omega}} \ll 1
\label{eq4},
\end{equation}
which defines the 2-level approximation
